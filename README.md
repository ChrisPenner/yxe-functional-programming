# First Steps

Hey! Before coming to the meet-up please follow the setup/installation instructions for [`Stack`](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)

Mac or Linux are strongly recommended if possible

Once you've got it installed, clone this repository, and `cd` inside, then run the following commands:
- `stack setup`: this downloads GHC (the Haskell compiler) and will likely take a while
- `stack build`: this downloads all the necessary libraries for our project
- `stack exec yxe-functional-programming-exe`: This will run the built executable

It will take a while, but if all went well then after running the last command you should see "Hello, World!" printed
to your console! If you have trouble getting something set up (or you're having difficulty on a Windows Machine) then
we'll try our best to help you at the meetup!
